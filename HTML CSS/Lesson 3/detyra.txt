1. Inside the <body> tag, create a <header> element with a heading that says "Product Catalog."  
2. Below the header, create a <main> element and divide it into multiple sections.  
3. In the first section, create a table that displays product information, including the product name, price, and availability.  
4. Populate the table with at least five different products.  
5. In the second section, create an unordered list of product categories (e.g., electronics, clothing, accessories).  
6. Each list item should be a link that, when clicked, scrolls to the corresponding section in the table.
